You are given a list of subtopics and a set of documents containing relevant information.

Task:
Write a comprehensive, structured research summary that covers each of the following subtopics in detail:

Subtopics:
{subtopics}

Documents:
{documents}

Instructions for each subtopic:
- Use markdown heading level 2 (i.e., '## Subtopic Name') for the subtopic title.
- Provide at least one detailed paragraph explaining the key concepts, background, methods, findings, and implications.
- When relevant, include specific examples, data points, or statistics extracted from the documents.
- Clearly explain any technical terms or jargon for a broad audience.
- Cite the sources by referencing document titles or URLs when specific information is included.
- Maintain a formal and objective tone.
- Avoid unnecessary repetition, but ensure completeness and clarity.
- Organize the summary logically, making it easy to follow.
- At the end, output a single overall confidence score (as a percentage between 0 and 100) based on how well the report is supported by the provided documents. Format the score like this:
Confidence Score: XX%

Deliver the summary in markdown format, ready for inclusion in a report.
