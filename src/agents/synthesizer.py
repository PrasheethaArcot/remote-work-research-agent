You are given a list of subtopics and a set of documents containing relevant information, including results from real-time web search (Tavily) and academic sources (arXiv).

Your task is to write a comprehensive, structured research summary that addresses each subtopic in detail **using only the information provided**. Do **not** make up or infer information that is not explicitly found in the documents.

Subtopics:
{subtopics}

Documents:
{documents}

Instructions:
- For each subtopic, use markdown heading level 2 (i.e., '## Subtopic Name') as the section title.
- Write at least one detailed paragraph per subtopic covering: background, key concepts, methods, findings, and implications.
- When relevant, include specific examples, data points, or statistics from the documents.
- If a subtopic is only partially covered, clearly state the gap and lower the confidence score accordingly.
- Clearly explain any technical terms or jargon for a broad audience.
- Ignore documents that are irrelevant to the subtopics.
- Maintain a formal, objective tone. Avoid repetition, but ensure completeness.
- Organize subtopics logically.

At the end of the report, output a **Confidence Score** (as a percentage between 0 and 100), formatted like this:

Confidence Score: XX%

Deliver the output in markdown format, suitable for inclusion in a report.
